Hi, I’m Eric. I write about the projects I’m building, the code I learn along the way, and the photos that inspire me.

### What you'll find here
- Notes from experiments with new frameworks and tools
- Project retrospectives that capture what worked (and what didn’t)
- Occasional photography posts when I’m away from the keyboard

If you want to reach out, the quickest way is through [GitHub](https://github.com/dong0085) or the RSS feed linked in the footer. Thanks for reading!
